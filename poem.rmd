## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!--> "The sun was shining on the sea,
      Shining with all his might:
He did his very best to make
      The billows smooth and bright —
And this was odd, because it was
      The middle of the night.


## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->Something there is that doesn’t love a wall,
That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it,
And spills the upper boulders in the sun;
And makes gaps even two can pass abreast.
The work of hunters is another thing:  jggcy
I have come after them and made repair
Where they have left not one stone on a stone,
But they would have the rabbit out of hiding,   
## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->"The sun was shining on the sea,
      Shining with all his might:
He did his very best to make
      The billows smooth and bright —


## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->In the tapestry of life, we weave our threads,
Moments of joy, and tears that life sheds.
A symphony of emotions, highs and lows,
A journey we embark on, as life unfolds.

A sunrise of hope, a sunset of dreams,
Navigating paths with unforeseen streams.
Lessons learned in every twist and turn,
Resilience and growth, the fires within burn.

Through storms we weather, and challenges faced,
Strength emerges, leaving no trace erased.
We dance with shadows, embrace the light,
Finding our purpose, in the darkest night.

Life's tapestry painted with vibrant hues,
Connections formed, binding hearts like glue.
Love's tender touch, a soothing balm,
A guiding force, in life's healing calm.

Friendships like stars, shining from afar,
Illuminate our lives, wherever we are.
Laughter, the music that fills our soul,
Melodies of joy, making us whole.

In solitude's embrace, we find inner peace,
Reflection and solitude, granting release.
Growth and transformation, as time goes by,
A symphony of moments, we cannot deny.

So let us cherish this gift we've been given,
Embrace the beauty in the life we're living.
With gratitude and love, let our spirits rise,
For in this journey called life, our souls find ties.
